# Bazaar White Paper

## Abstract

The general idea of Bazaar is to create a peer-to-peer (P2P) marketplace that enables transactions for decentralized services such as:

- File sharing
- Communication
- Virtual machines
- Large Language Models (LLMs)
- And many more...

To facilitate these transactions, two networks will be created:

1. **Bazaar** – This network operates vendors and patrons, allowing them to exchange decentralized services.
2. **Hawala** – This network manages authentication and transactions, ensuring secure and trustworthy interactions.

## Introduction

### Problem Statement
Traditional online marketplaces rely on centralized intermediaries that impose high fees, control access, and introduce privacy concerns. Furthermore, trust between parties is enforced through reputation systems controlled by a central authority, limiting accessibility and flexibility.

Bazaar aims to address these challenges by providing a fully decentralized marketplace that enables direct peer-to-peer (P2P) transactions for various services. By leveraging blockchain-based contracts, decentralized authentication, and escrow mechanisms, Bazaar eliminates intermediaries and enhances security, trust, and accessibility for users worldwide.

### Key Features
- **Decentralized Transactions** – Users can engage in service exchanges without relying on centralized entities.
- **Smart Contracts** – Automated contract execution ensures fair transactions and dispute resolution.
- **Hawala Authentication** – A decentralized identity verification system builds trust among participants.
- **Escrow-Based Payments** – Payments are held securely until service completion.
- **Versatile Service Offerings** – Supports a wide range of digital and computational services.

## Control Flow

### Transaction Process

The transaction workflow in the Bazaar ecosystem follows a structured process to ensure security and reliability:

```
Client API -> Requests Service -> Vendor Responds ->
Contract Created -> Payment Escrowed -> Task Completed ->
Payment Sent to Vendor
```

This sequence ensures that services are requested, contracts are formed, payments are securely held in escrow, and only upon completion of the task, the vendor receives the payment.

### Authentication Process

The authentication process leverages the **Hawala** network to establish client identity and trustworthiness:

```
Client API -> Request Auth From Trusted Hawala Network ->
Hawala Creates Client Certificate
```

This mechanism ensures that users in the Bazaar ecosystem are authenticated through a decentralized but trusted network before engaging in transactions.

### Hawala Verification

The **Hawala** verification process ensures trust and credibility within the Bazaar ecosystem:

```
Client API -> Request Hawala Trust Verification -> 
Transaction Blockchain Averages Contract Success -> 
Trust Grade Associated and Returned
```

The client API requests trust verification from the **Hawala** network. The system then evaluates previous transactions stored on the blockchain to calculate an averaged success rate for contracts. Based on this evaluation, a **trust grade** is generated and returned to the client. This grade helps determine the reliability of participants within the Bazaar ecosystem.
